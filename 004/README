Hitting Rock Bottom

To solve the problem, I went for fewest lines of code possible while still
maintaining decent readability. I figured the best way to achieve this in
Ruby, with its many convenient string methods, would be to use primarily
string manipulation rather than creating other data structures. I'm thinking I
ended up being wrong here, so I'm anxious to see other submissions that make
more use of data structures.

Along the way I also tried to be pretty clever with syntax where possible, since,
you know, you don't get to do that with "real work" very often ;)

To run:
