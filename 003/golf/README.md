#Code Golf

This the least amount of code I can come up with.  Contains 235 chars or 215 if you don't include the #! part.  Interesting to see if there is any way to make this even smaller.

##Description
You run the program like this: `cave filename`.  The file should contain the number of iterations on the first line, followed by a blank line, then followed by the map of the cave.  It will display the depth of each column after the iterations.

##Comments
`$w` is the width of the cave (including the carriage return).

`$d` is the data (ie. the map of the cave).

`$n` is the number of iterations.

`f` is the function that fills the cave with water.
